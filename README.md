# Psychic-Game - Homework Assignment #3 - Javascript

Instructions

1.  The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

2.  Guess what letter I'm thinking of

3.  Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

4.  Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

5.  Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

6.  Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

7.  When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

8.  When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

The purpose of this assignment was to test our knowledge of how to use Javascript functions to create a dynamic site that 'interacts' with the user. The use of
JS functions, if statements, and understanding of variable assignment were all essential to completing this assignment.

I was able to code the main functions of the game. One thing that I wasn't able to do was restrict what the user could enter, that is, make it so the program does not run
if the user pressed anything other than a letter key.
