# Psychic Game

### Overview

This is the third assignment for the Coding Bootcamp delivered at University of Toronto Mississauga.

In this assignment we were required to use Javascript functions to create a dynamic site that 'interacts' with the user. The use of Javascript functions, if statements, and understanding of variable assignment were all essential to completing this assignment.

I was able to code the main functions of the game. One thing that I wasn't able to do was restrict what the user could enter, that is, make it so the program does not run
if the user pressed anything other than a letter key.

### Description

The app randomly picks a letter on the back end, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose by pressing different letter keys. The guessed letters are displayed on the screen, so the user can remember what they previously selected.

The user has nine attempts to select the correct letter. If the user guesses correctly before their attempts run out, then their number of wins increases; if they don't, then this counts as a loss. When the user wins or loses, the game restarts without frefreshing the page.
